##### Reasons
Most of us at some moment of time struggle with overload of information. We have messengers, accounts 
in social networks, use recomendation engines (like google feed or yandex zen). Yeach of these sources 
has a loot of unimportant news and flood, so it become very easy to skip something realy important. 
For example in my case at this period of time information about significant changes of exchange rates 
is very usefull to know. So I created telegram bot which collects news from different sources, filters them
by keywords and sends notification with filtered news in telegram. Bot checks information each hour to prevent 
often distractions. This bot really helps to decrease informational overload and concentrate on more 
important things.
