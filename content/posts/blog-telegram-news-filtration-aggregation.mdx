##### Reasons
Most of us at some moment of time struggle with overload of information. We have messengers, accounts in social networks, use recommendation engines (like Google Feed or Yandex Zen). Each of these sources has a lot of unimportant news and spam, so it became very easy to skip something really important. For example, in my case at this period of time information about significant changes of exchange rates is very useful to know. So, I created telegram bot which collects news from different sources, filters them by keywords and sends notification with filtered news in telegram. Bot checks information each hour to prevent often distractions. This bot really helps to decrease informational overload and helps to concentrate on more important things.

##### Implementation
First of all, you need to create bot and get its token. It is very easy to do with [@BotFather]( https://t.me/botfather).  Then you need to create cloud function to parse rss feeds.
I’ve chosen Yandex Cloud since it is cheap and has convenient and flexible cloud functions. Code of function is [here] (https://github.com/bakuteyev/telegram-news-filtration). It uses environment variables which you need specify in corresponding fields. To make it work you need to fill news sources and keywords. There is list of rss urls in `news_sources` field. You can change it to your own. Just open your news source website and search for rss on its page or just google it. `KEYWORDS` is environment variable. It is a string which consists of keywords of phrases separated by comas with no extra spaces.

As you can see, I use channel name as TELEGRAM_ID. You also can create channel and give bot write permission, or you can just use your own ID (but of course you need to start bot before it).

To make it run on a schedule you need to create trigger.

That is all! You are ready to use it.

##### Conclusion
It is very easy to create your own news filtration and aggregation bot and it is really helpful. But if you don’t want to spend time on development you can use more advanced version of bot [https://t.me/ai_filtered_news_bot](https://t.me/ai_filtered_news_bot). It supports multiple users and supports commands for setting keywords and news sources. And it is completely free!
