Hello world. I am Anton Bakuteev and it is my first blog post. 
I started this blog just for fun on winter holidays. 
I am working as Data Analyst/Scientist. 
And I decided to learn more about  frontend stuff. 
So this is basicaly just my second JS project.
I hope it will be useful for me and maybe also for you.

About how I've built this blog you will 
know in my next <Link to={`/posts/blog-gatsby-yandex-object-storage`}>post.</Link>
