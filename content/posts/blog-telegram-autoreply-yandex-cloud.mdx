##### The purpose
At the moment telegram doesn't have built-in option to do it. 
Since I am using telegram a lot at my job, it is very important to let 
colleagues know when I am not available. The most common scenario 
for me is when I am on vocations and have no access to internet. 


I've found some existing solutions, but they are hosted directly 
[on your smartphone](https://www.autoresponder.ai) or there 
is [no host proposed](https://medium.com/@jiayu./automatic-replies-for-telegram-85075f28321).
What makes it useless when you have no access to internet.


In this article I'll describe approach how to host auto responder in 
[Yandex Compute Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/services/compute) 
and use it on demand via telegram bot based on serverless 
[Yandex Cloud Functions](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/services/functions).

<br></br>

##### The code

Code is [here](https://github.com/bakuteyev/autoreply). The main idea is to have serverless telegram bot as a 
trigger for another bot which is not serverless. The serverless bot is very cheap, since you only pay 
for each message and don't pay when you have no messages. 

For auto reply part I am using the smallest possible instance, which is also the cheapest. 
It has 2 cores (5% of performance for each core) and 512MB RAM. It costs about 2.88$ per month, what is quite cheap.

<br></br>

I was thinking to make it serverless too, but preferred  to save my time instead, since I already had script 
[non serverless auto reply script](https://medium.com/@jiayu./automatic-replies-for-telegram-85075f28321). 

I've put content of `cloud_function/autoreplier_starter.py` in editor and initialized corresponding environment 
variables. This script uses Yandex Cloud API, it starts prepared instance, connects to it via ssh and starts 
`autoreply.py` script, which should be preliminary copied there with `.env` file which contains tokens. 
If message in trigger corresponds to stop command it stops instance to save money.

<br></br>

To make it run in telegram you should create bot and bind it to cloud function via webhook.

```
curl -F "url=https://functions.yandexcloud.net/{secret_function_id}" https://api.telegram.org/bot{secret_bot_key}/setWebhook
```
<br></br>

That is basically all. For convenience  I added two commands to bot.

<br></br>

Pay attention, that autoreply will look like answers come directly from you.

##### Results and future plans
I find this bot very useful though it is not free, the price is worth it.
