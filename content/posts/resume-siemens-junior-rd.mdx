* Responsibilities
    * Collaborated with colleagues from Germany on gas turbine projects, such as:
        * Creating new neural networks-based algorithms to improve turbine blades optimizer.
        * Developing neural network models to predict blades' Von Mises stress.
        * Creating a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) application to predict scrap rates for blades and vanes in gas turbines. Acted as project manager in scrap rates prediction project, involving planning and understanding customer's business needs.


* Impact
    * Improved existing optimizer for blades and vanes design, resulting in improved computational performance.
    * Developed Von Mises stress prediction model using Machine Learning, which is 10 times faster than physical modeling.
    * Identified existing data problems for Scrap Rates PoC, leading to successful collaboration between 3 departments. Developed ML model to not only predict, but also identify outliers and physical dependencies.
