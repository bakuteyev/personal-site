* Responsibilities
    * Gas turbine projects in collaboration with colleagues from Germany:
        * Created new neural networks based algorithm to improve turbine's blades optimizer.
        * Developed neural network to predict blade's Von Mises stress.
        * Created PoC application to predict scrap rates for blades and vanes in gas turbines. Acted as project manager in scrap rates prediction project (planning and understand the customer’s business needs)


* Impact
    * Algorithm for blades and vanes design optimization improved existing optimizer and improved computational performance.
    * Von Mises stress prediction model allows to replace physical modeling by ML, what is 10 times faster.
    * Found existing data problems for Scrap Rates PoC. This PoC become the point of collaboration between 3 departments, which didn't know about common problems. ML model not only predicts, but also allows to find outliers and physical dependencies.
