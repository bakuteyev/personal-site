Full time internship during the second year of the magistracy
* Responsibilities
    *  Created BI reports for water supply monitoring system and improved their evaluation speed more than 10 times.
    *  Created Java endpoints to improve performance and added new functionality.
    *  Wrote a few invention disclosures for water supply systems.
    *  Created master's thesis in collaboration with Siemens about applications of Game Theory (Minimization of water consumption peak) and Machine Learning (Forecasting of water consumption for non automated flow meters) to water supply systems.
* Impact
    *  As an intern I saved Siemens a lot of money (because they didn't need to hire FTEs) without quality losses.
    *  Customers became interested in my master thesis.
    *  Because of performance improvements user experience became significantly better.
